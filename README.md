# Glassdoor Salary Prediction

This project predicts salaries for different job roles using data collected from Glassdoor.  
The dataset contains company and job details such as Company Name, Location, Size, Industry, Sector, Revenue, Job Title, and Description.  
The goal is to analyze factors affecting salary and build machine learning models to predict estimated salaries.

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, fix inconsistencies, standardize categories.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand how factors like company size, industry, or location influence salaries.  
3. **Model Building** – Compare linear models, tree-based models, and ensemble methods.  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Improve best-performing model with parameter optimization.  
5. **Prediction & Insights** – Generate salary predictions for unseen job roles.

## Tech Stack
